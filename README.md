An interpretation of a popular story
====================================

Most Vietnamese passing elementary school knows the story of [Thánh Gióng](http://www.justkids.com.vn/chuyen-ke-cho-be/truyen-co-tich-thanh-giong-243.html), a well-known folk tale and legend from a long time in the past.

## The story

To sum up, the [Shang Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang_dynasty) (a.k.a. [nhà Ân](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nh%C3%A0_Th%C6%B0%C6%A1ng) in Vietnamese) invaded the ancient Vietnam. (_Note_: There is no historical basis for this!)
[Hùng Vương](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B9ng_king) (the common name for ancient Vietnamese kings) looked for people to help defend the country.
There was a woman getting pregnant after trying to put her foot in a gigantic footprint that she saw in the garden one morning.
Her son was a peculiar child who could not speak at 3 years old but he suddenly responded to the call.
He asked the king for the weapons, let me quote
> Về bảo với nhà vua rèn cho ta một **con ngựa sắt**, một thanh gươm sắt, một giáp sắt và một nón sắt, ta sẽ đánh đuổi giặc dữ cho!
and within a few days, he consumed everything the people could provide and became a strong grown up man.

You can guess the progress of the story: Giong defeated the enemy.
In the end, he took off the equipments and left for the heaven.

## A bit recall of childhood

Back when I was a child, I find the story quite odd.

 1. The name Gióng is unfortunately very rare. I do not ever recall any Vietnamese sharing the name in history.
 2. The title Thánh (Saint) is obviously not used in the ancient past.
 3. The period that the story supposedly happens is the bronze age. How can they make iron weapons?

These can be explained by the fact that the story might have been retold many times and each adaptation changes it to fit the time period, perhaps mixed with other mythology from other cultures.

## My interpretation in modern time

Over the years, I find out that this is a really inspiring story that should perhaps be reclassified as a Science Fiction.
The story depicts 3 branches of modern science and engineering which none of my fellow Vietnamese masters

 1. _Biotechnology_: Gióng has no father, has superhuman strength and can become a grown up in days.
    Isn't that a kind of biological miracle?
    Observe that no other human is given name in the story (Hùng Vương does not count since it is a collective name).
    Gióng's mother could be viewed as an anonymous test subject or I would like to say, the scientist who performed gene modifications and IVF on herself.

 2. _Robotics_: One of Gióng's demand is an iron horse (con ngựa sắt that I quoted above).
    What kind of horse could run and spit fire unless it is made by [Boston Dynamics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF4DML7FIWk)?

 3. _Aeronautics and space travel_: At the end of the story, Gióng left the Earth for the heaven.
    Where did he go if not to travel amongst the stars?

The story depicts science accurately and we see the relationship between the three fields.
The key limitation for us human to travel to the stars is our body.
It cannot stand the zero/low gravity environment.
It does not last very long and requires an energy source (food + water) that is not easily procured in space.

I used to think that robots can be sent into space as substitute for human.
While they could deal with gravity-energy issue, even they cannot withstand the [amount of radiation in space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaZ_RSt0KP8).
And their hardware deteriorates like our body: You can send out a robot with, say 100 SSDs, for backup but that will run out as well so unless the robot is programmed to be able to survey and procure the materials in exoplanets and then manufacture their body parts, they too will not last.
But robots do have great uses in building our space infrastructure.

So it is pretty much impossible for mankind to go beyond the solar system.
In order to go beyond our prison in the universe and improve civilization as a species, we have to modify ourselves.
I think that is the wish of my ancient Vietnamese ancestors and perhaps of all mankind that I hope we could one day fulfill.

_Digression_: I think the story also depicts well the social aspect.
The fact that Gióng did not speak at 3 years old is probably because he is not human.
The fact that he decided to leave is also because he does not (feel that he should) belong here: After all, he could wipe out an army. Why shouldn't the Vietnamese in the story be not afraid of him?
